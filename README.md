# ðŸ“Š Microservices-Based Expense Tracker

A modular, microservices-based **Expense Tracker** application built with **Spring Boot**, **MongoDB**, and **Docker**.  
This project manages **users, transactions, and budgets** as separate microservices, allowing scalable and maintainable architecture.  
**Postman** is used for testing all REST APIs for CRUD operations.

## Overview
This project implements a **microservices architecture** for expense tracking.  
Each module is developed as a separate Spring Boot application with its own MongoDB database.  
Communication between services can be handled asynchronously (Kafka optional).  
Centralized configuration can be managed via Spring Cloud Config.  

All **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are exposed via **REST APIs** and tested using **Postman**, allowing you to quickly fetch, post, update, and delete data in each microservice.

## Microservices
1. **Expense User Tracker**
   - Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
   - Provides REST APIs for CRUD operations on users.
   - Example APIs:
     - `GET /users` â€“ Fetch all users
     - `POST /users` â€“ Add a new user
     - `PUT /users/{id}` â€“ Update a user
     - `DELETE /users/{id}` â€“ Delete a user

2. **Expense Transaction Tracker**
   - Manages expense and income transactions.
   - Supports asynchronous processing via Kafka (if configured).
   - Example APIs:
     - `GET /transactions` â€“ Fetch all transactions
     - `POST /transactions` â€“ Add a transaction
     - `PUT /transactions/{id}` â€“ Update a transaction
     - `DELETE /transactions/{id}` â€“ Delete a transaction

3. **Expense Budget Tracker**
   - Tracks budgets for users and generates reports.
   - Uses MongoDB for storing budget data.
   - Runs in Docker container for easy deployment.
   - Example APIs:
     - `GET /budgets` â€“ Fetch all budgets
     - `POST /budgets` â€“ Add a new budget
     - `PUT /budgets/{id}` â€“ Update budget
     - `DELETE /budgets/{id}` â€“ Delete budget

## REST APIs
All microservices expose **REST APIs** for CRUD operations.  
You can test them easily with Postman.

### Example Postman Requests

**User Microservice**

'''' json

POST /users
{
  "name": "user",
  "email": "user@gmail.com",
  "password": "password1234"
}

Transaction Microservice:
'''' json 
POST /transactions
{
  "userId": "12334", // once you update the user details & you will get USERID ( it will generate UserID automatically) 
  "type": "expense",
  "amount": 500.00,
  "description": "Groceries"
}

Budget Microservice :
''''' json

POST /budgets
{
  "userId": "12345",
  "month": "September",
  "limit": 2000
}
